This python program (WORDLE.py), runs a wordle game.

In the game, the user has to guess a five letter word which is chosen from a list of five letter words I have entered in the code.

The user can only guess a word from the english dictionary, otherwise it would be invalid. The user gets a total of six tries to guess the words
after which they lose and the word is revealed.

After each guess, the user is shown whether any of the letters in the guess are same as that in the word, and whether they are in the correct position
or a different position. Using these hints, the user has to guess the word.

If the user guesses the word within 6 moves, they win.
