This C project is set in the scenario where the cashier has to give the customer the change that is 
owed to them, but the cashier must do so using least amount of coins possible.

When the code is run, the user is prompted with the amount(change) that is owed to them in cents.
Then the code runs a greedy algorithm that returns the least amount of coins required to complete the amount.

Coins used are --->

penny = 1 cent
nickel = 5 cents
dime = 10 cents
quarter = 25 cents
